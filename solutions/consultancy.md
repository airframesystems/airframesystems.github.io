Airframe Systems can provide industry experts to independently review airframe designs from conceptual design through to support solutions. With expertise in the integration of all aspects of the life cycle we can help identify and mitigate safety and financial risks at key stages of an aerospace project. Our engineers have typically over 30 years of experience at the highest levels of seniority and signatory authority within the aerospace business. They are all qualified and members of recognised Aerospace and Engineering Institutions such as the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS), the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET).

They have experience with working in an international market with major aerospace companies and government agencies. Airframe Systems cover all aspects of the aerospace total business life cycle. From research and development to concept design, manufacture, installation, qualification and certification, production build, support and disposal. We can provide experts to advise on aerospace capability management, organisational development, governance, compliancy and regulatory issues. With experience not only in Military and Civil projects, but with Civil to Military Conversion we can offer capability that is second to none.
