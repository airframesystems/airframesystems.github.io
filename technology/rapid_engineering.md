Rapid Engineering encompasses techniques and technologies that streamline the time from original concept design through to in-service use. Airframe Systems has expertise in and access to such methods as follows:

#### Reverse Engineering

Essential when the original design information is no longer accessible or available. Airframe Systems can provide advice and capability to reverse engineer the physical item to establish a revised baseline from which to implement modification design or repairs. Techniques utilised include laser scanning.

#### Rapid Prototyping

* Stereolithography
* Laser Scanning
* Selective Laser Sintering

#### Rapid Tooling

Use of ALM technology for tooling, moulding.

#### Rapid Authoring

By applying state of the art technology.
